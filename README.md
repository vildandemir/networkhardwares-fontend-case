Welcome to the Network Hardwares Frontend Developer recruitment challenge! This case study is designed to assess your skills and expertise in React and CSS. Below you will find the details necessary to complete this project, hosted on GitHub.
## Project Overview
This project involves creating a simple yet effective user interface to search for and display movies using the IMDb API, via the OMDb API. The aim is to evaluate your ability to integrate with APIs, manipulate data, and present it through a user-friendly interface using React and modern CSS practices.
## Technical Setup
Starter Template: We have provided a minimal setup that gets you started with React in a Vite environment. This setup is designed to let you focus on coding without worrying about the initial configuration.
## Requirements
1. **API Integration**:
    * Implement functionality to search for movies using the OMDb API.
    * Ensure you manage and handle the API key securely.
2. **Search Results**:
    * Display the search results on the screen as clickable cards. Each card should represent a movie, showing relevant information such as the title and year.
    * Implement responsive design to ensure usability across different devices and screen sizes.
3. **Movie Details**:
    * Upon clicking a movie card, a modal should appear displaying detailed information about the movie. This can include the director, genre, plot, and any other pertinent details provided by the API.
    * The modal should also include a close button to return to the search results.
